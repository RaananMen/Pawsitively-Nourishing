              <h2>The Benefits of Different Types of Animal Food</h2>
                <div class="food-type">
                    <p>There are many different types of food you can feed your animal, including:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Wet food</li>

                        <li>Dehydrated food</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each type of food has its own benefits and drawbacks. For example:</p>

                        <li>Dry food is convenient and can help keep your animal's teeth clean, but may not be as flavorful as wet food.</li>
                        <li>Wet food is more flavorful and can help keep your animal hydrated, but may not be as convenient as dry food.</li>
                        <li>Raw food is more natural and can provide more nutrients, but may not be as safe or convenient as other types of food.</li>
                        <li>Dehydrated food is lightweight and easy to store, but may not be as fresh as other types of food.</li>
